📊 Bank Marketing Dataset - Exploratory Analysis
This repository contains an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Bank Marketing dataset. The primary objective is to understand the dataset’s structure, identify patterns, and lay the groundwork for future modeling tasks.

🔍 Key Insights:
The dataset captures customer demographics, contact history, and economic indicators — useful for customer segmentation and targeting.

The target variable (y) is highly imbalanced, with most customers not subscribing to a term deposit.

This EDA includes:

Data cleaning checks (missing values, data types)

Summary statistics

Target variable distribution

Correlation insights between numerical features

🚀 Next Steps:
Feature engineering & encoding

Handling class imbalance

Model building for term deposit prediction

Evaluation with metrics suited for imbalanced data

This analysis provides a strong foundation for building data-driven marketing strategies and predictive models.
